            <p3>Caroline Polachek is a popstar who emerged in the 2000s. She practices merging folk, pop, digital and at times somewhat ethereal elements in her musical practice and aesthetical expression. She is very y2k and internet and sexy. She attracts and inspires an alternative, sometimes queer, often feminist, powerful crowd. </p3>
